tagline: SPEL is dedicated to space and geoscience instrumentation research and development.
space: The Laboratory serves as a hub for researchers, engineers and students at UCH and USACH to collaborate on space physics and space instrumentation. Highlighted activities are related to Ionospheric modeling and simulation, very small satellite development (Cubesats and kiksats) and space instrumentation (magnetometers, Langmuir Probes and VLF to UHF receivers).
geoscience: Develop of seismic sensors applied science.
miniaturization:

The Space and Planetary Exploration Laboratory (SPEL), since its conception in 2011, has served as a bridge
between the Radio Astronomy Instrumentation Group (RAIG), and other research groups related to the geosciences.
In particular, the Laboratory is concentrated in areas related to Space, Atmosphere and solid Earth. RAIG, 
established in 2008, is a group that includes academics, laboratories and personnel from Electrical Engineering (DIE) 
and Astronomy (DAS) Departments at the Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (FCFM) at Universidad de Chile (UCH).
The SPEL, as part of RAIG, has extended the relationships to the Geophysics (DGF), Physics (DFI) and Mechanical
Engineering (DIMec) Departments at UCH, and to the Physics Department at Universidad de Santiago de Chile (USACH).
