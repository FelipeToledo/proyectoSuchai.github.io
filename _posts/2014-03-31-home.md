tagline: SPEL is dedicated to research and development of instrumentation for the geosciences.
space: The Laboratory serves as a hub for researchers, engineers and students at UCH and USACH to collaborate on space physics and space instrumentation. Highlighted activities are related to Ionospheric modeling and simulation, very small satellite development (femto-, pico- and nano-satellites) and space instrumentation (magnetometers, Langmuir Probes and VLF to UHF receivers).
geoscience: The developed radio astronomy and space instrumentation expertise has been also used in multiple geo-scientific initiatives. In particular, the laboratory is collaborating with different initiatives of the department of geophysics at UCH related to atmospheric and seismic measurements. 
miniaturization: In the last two decades space technology has moved from a multi-goal, large and expensive approach to a Faster-Better-Cheaper (FBC) approach for the space missions. Following that trend the Laboratory has been working on methodologies that allow simplify missions (technically and organizationally) and reduce costs. In this line the Lab has been exploring two lines of action distributed measuring (sensor networks) and miniaturization of the systems (saving space, weight and energy).

The Space and Planetary Exploration Laboratory (SPEL), since its conception in 2011, has served as a bridge
between the Radio Astronomy Instrumentation Group (RAIG), and other research groups related to the geosciences.
In particular, the Laboratory is concentrated in areas related to Space, Atmosphere and solid Earth. RAIG, 
established in 2008, is a group that includes academics, laboratories and personnel from Electrical Engineering (DIE) 
and Astronomy (DAS) Departments at the Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (FCFM) at Universidad de Chile (UCH).
The SPEL, as part of RAIG, has extended the relationships to the Geophysics (DGF), Physics (DFI) and Mechanical
Engineering (DIMec) Departments at UCH, and to the Physics Department at Universidad de Santiago de Chile (USACH).
