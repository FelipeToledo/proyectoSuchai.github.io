    - name: SUCHAI
      brief: Satellite of University of Chile for Aerospace Investigation
      description: SUCHAI is the first chilean made satellite project developed by students, engineers and professors of many departments of the University of Chile such as the Electrical Engineering, Physics and Mechanical Engineering Departments. The main goal is to design, construct, launch and operate a picosatellite.

    - name: Fabless manufacturing of integrated circuits
      brief: Design and implement integrated circuits to be used in areas such as  geophysics, biomedical, astronomical instrumentation or telecommunications.
      description: Since John Bardeen, Walter Brattain and William Shockley invented the first transistor at Bell Labs in 1947 electronics in general has experienced an accelerated evolution, leading to the first integrated circuit by Jack Kilby in the 60s with a refined version of Robert Noyce later on. From that moment on the technology related to electronics has grown and evolved at an accelerated rate, always re-inventing itself, reaching smaller transistor than a simple cell or chips capable of harvesting energy from biological phenomena. This way, microelectronics has become a strategic capability for many countries and a technology capable of enabling other emerging technologies.
      Under this constant evolution the Space and Planetary Exploration Laboratory created a project with the point designing and implementing integrated circuits (IC), both analog and digital, to be used in different areas and for different purposes such as geophysics, biomedical, astronomical instrumentation, telecommunications, etc. Making use of "fabless manufacturing" philosophy, free software and the MOSIS educational program, we have manage to design small integrated amplifiers, the basic unit of any analog circuit such as ADC or DAC, and it is expected that in the near future that mixed signal circuit or fully digital, always with the assistance, cooperation and enthusiasm of colleagues and researchers from the Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile.

    - name: Multipurpose signal register SPQR
      brief: Primarily developed for Seismic Tomography this signal register (in development stage) is capable of digitalize, synchronize (acurately to GPS time) and save to disk signal samples from diferent sources. Currently there are two ADC developed, one for three-axis geophones, and other for a type-K thermocouple.
