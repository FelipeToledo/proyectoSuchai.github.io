SUCHAI (Satellite of University of Chile for Aerospace Investigation) is the first chilean made satellite project developed by students, engineers and professors of many departments of the University of Chile such as the Electrical Engineering, Physics and Mechanical Engineering Departments.
The main goal is to design, construct, launch and operate a picosatellite.

Consists in an 1U Cubesat satellite with educational and scientific purposes developed mainly by undergrad students. The spacecraft consists of three main subsystems:

* **On board computer:** the C&DH unit responsible of flight operation of the satellite. Uses a custom Flight Software for low power embedded systems.
* **Communications:** an UHF transceiver to enable telemetry download, CW beacon broadcast and telecommands upload.
* **Energy:** and EPS device that uses solar panels array to charge a battery and supply energy to the satellite.

SUCHAI mission considers the following payloads:

* **Langmuir probe:** the main scientific goal of this payload is to study the ionosphere in synchronization with incoherent scatter radar (ISR) to take simultaneous measurements of ionospheric plasma parameters.
* **Experiment:** Study of heat dissipation for electronic devices in vacuum environments.
* **Camera:** a digital camera to take photos of the earth and deployment moment.
* **GPS:** A GPS receiver to get the position of the spacecraft
