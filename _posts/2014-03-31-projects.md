brief: All SPEL projects follow the Open Source and Open Hardware philosophy. If you are interested in one of our projects don't hesitate and contact us
brief2: Satellites are nowadays used in every-day life, GPS, TV transmission, Internet and weather forecast being the most famous examples. The communication sub-systems (COM),  the On Board Computer (OBC) and the Energy Power System (EPS) all lie at the heart of every spacecraft, small or big. Continuous R&D activities try to make this subsystems better, smaller, and more efficient.  In parallel, the recent introduction of the Cubesat standard and its use of nontraditional risk-taking development approaches to achieve low-cost and fast-delivery has revolutionized the space sector by allowing literally hundreds of new actors to enter.  At the SPEL laboratory we are developing a space program based on Cubesat mission. Our goal is to design, develop and launch a Cubesat mission every two years.

    - name: SUCHAI 1
    status: Active (Integrated into P-POD in Netherlands waiting to be carried on to USA for final integration in a Spacex's Falcon 9 rocket)
    description: Satellite of University of Chile for Aerospace Investigation. SUCHAI is the first chilean CubeSat developed by undergraduate students, engineers and professors of the Electrical Engineering, Physics and Mechanical Engineering Departments at Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (FCFM) at Universidad de Chile. It has three main goals: (1) Generate avanced human resources, (2) Create space technology in our country and (3) serve a vehicle to carry scientific expirements in space.
