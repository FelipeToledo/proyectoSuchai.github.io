brief: All SPEL projects follow the Open Source and Open Hardware philosophy. If you are interested in one of our projects don't hesitate and contact us
brief2: Satellites are nowadays used in every-day life, GPS, TV transmission, Internet and weather forecast being the most famous examples. The communication sub-systems (COM),  the On Board Computer (OBC) and the Energy Power System (EPS) all lie at the heart of every spacecraft, small or big. Continuous R&D activities try to make this subsystems better, smaller, and more efficient.  In parallel, the recent introduction of the Cubesat standard and its use of nontraditional risk-taking development approaches to achieve low-cost and fast-delivery has revolutionized the space sector by allowing literally hundreds of new actors to enter.  At the SPEL laboratory we are developing a space program based on Cubesat mission. Our goal is to design, develop and launch a Cubesat mission every two years. 
projects:
    - name: SUCHAI
      status: Active, scheduled for launch by a Falcon 9 rocket in May 2016
      description: Satellite of University of Chile for Aerospace Investigation. SUCHAI is the first chilean CubeSat developed by undergraduate students, engineers and professors of the Electrical Engineering, Physics and Mechanical Engineering Departments of the Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (FCFM) at Universidad de Chile. The main goal is to learn the whole chain process designing, building/integrating, launching and operating a picosatellite.

    - name: Fabless manufacturing of integrated circuits
      status: Active
      description: Integrations of circuits with the purpose of miniaturization of circuits for sensors used in several areas such as communications, biomedical, geophysics or astronomical instrumentation. Under the constant evolution of technology, the Space and Planetary Exploration Laboratory created a project with the point designing and implementing integrated circuits (IC), both analog and digital, to be used in different areas and for different purposes such as geophysics, biomedical, astronomical instrumentation, telecommunications, etc. Making use of "fabless manufacturing" philosophy, free software and the MOSIS educational program, we have manage to design small integrated amplifiers, the basic unit of any analog circuit such as ADC or DAC, and it is expected that in the near future that mixed signal circuit or fully digital, always with the assistance, cooperation and enthusiasm of colleagues and researchers from the Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile.

    - name: Seismic Register SPQR
      status: Active, in test phase
      description: Primarily developed for Seismic Tomography this signal register (in development stage) is capable of digitalize, synchronize (to GPS time) and save to disk (MSEED, ASCII formats) signal samples from different sources. It is based on Low-cost and COTS products (Raspberry Pi and Arduino), the idea is to create an open Hw seismic register for scietific purposes.

    - name: SUCHAI2 and SUCHA3
      status: Active, design phase
      description: Next iterations of our satellite. This time we are developing two 3U Cubesats!!.

    - name: Integration and testing of commercial SBC (Single Board Computers) as OBC for Cubesats
      status: Open position for Master/Doctoral students
      description: Traditionally OBCs have been specially fabricated to endure the rush conditions in space, but this approach has lead them to be fairly outdated and expensive processors compared to their counterparts back on earth. In this sense, the goal of this project is to take advantage of the new low-power and high-performance SBC (Single Board Computers) designed for IoT connectivity and for the Hacker/Maker community (e.g. Raspberry Pi, Intel Edison, Arduino, among others) and adapt them to the Cubesat standard, and if possible for space conditions. All of these to ultimately evaluate how they perform in LEO (Low Earth Orbits) inside a real Cubesat mission

    - name: Width-band uplink & downlink communication subsystem for Cubesats at the S-Band
      status: Open position for Master/Doctoral students
      description: In the case of the COM subsystem, the higher data-rates are achieved the newer and more exciting applications are possible. In this sense, the goal of this project is to develop and test an S-band transceiver for Cubesat missions. There are S-band radios in the market, but they are not applicable for Cubesat missions, in terms of cost, size and power consumption. Therefore a specific approach towards miniaturization and efficiency is required

    - name: Width-band inter-satellite communication subsystem for Cubesats at 60 GHz
      status: Open position for Master/Doctoral students
      description: In the case of the COM subsystem, the higher data-rates are achieved the newer and more exciting applications are possible. In this sense, the goal of this project is to develop and test a 60 GHz transceiver for Cubesat missions. The systems shall be design to communicate between satellites in space, rather than between a satellite and its ground station.
