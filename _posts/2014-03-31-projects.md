    - name: SUCHAI
      brief: Satellite of University of Chile for Aerospace Investigation
      description: SUCHAI is the first chilean CubeSat developed by undergraduate students, engineers and professors of the Electrical Engineering, Physics and Mechanical Engineering Departments of the Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (FCFM) at Universidad de Chile. The main goal is to learn the whole chain process designing, building/integrating, launching and operating a picosatellite.

    - name: Fabless manufacturing of integrated circuits
      brief: Integrations of circuits with the purpose of miniaturization of circuits for sensors used in several areas such as communications, biomedical, geophysics or astronomical instrumentation.  
      description: Under the constant evolution of technology, the Space and Planetary Exploration Laboratory created a project with the point designing and implementing integrated circuits (IC), both analog and digital, to be used in different areas and for different purposes such as geophysics, biomedical, astronomical instrumentation, telecommunications, etc. Making use of "fabless manufacturing" philosophy, free software and the MOSIS educational program, we have manage to design small integrated amplifiers, the basic unit of any analog circuit such as ADC or DAC, and it is expected that in the near future that mixed signal circuit or fully digital, always with the assistance, cooperation and enthusiasm of colleagues and researchers from the Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile.

    - name: Multipurpose signal register SPQR
      brief: Primarily developed for Seismic Tomography this signal register (in development stage) is capable of digitalize, synchronize (accurately to GPS time) and save to disk signal samples from different sources. Currently there are two ADC developed, one for three-axis geophones, and other for a type-K thermocouple.
