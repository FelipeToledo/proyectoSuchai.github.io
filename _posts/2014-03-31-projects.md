    - name: Fabless manufacturing of integrated circuits
      brief: Design and implement integrated circuits to be used in areas such as  geophysics, biomedical, astronomical instrumentation or telecommunications.
      description: Using the idea of ​​"fabless manufacturing" and free software, it has been possible design small integrated amplifiers, the basic unit of analog circuits. In the near future is expected to achieve mixed signal circuits and digital circuits. This project has the support of students and researchers from the Catholic University of Chile.

    - name: Multipurpose signal register SPQR
      brief: Primarily developed for Seismic Tomography this signal register (in development stage) is capable of digitalize, synchronize (acurately to GPS time) and save to disk signal samples from diferent sources. Currently there are two ADC developed, one for three-axis geophones, and other for a type-K thermocouple.
