    - name: SUCHAI
      status: Active
      description: Satellite of University of Chile for Aerospace Investigation. SUCHAI is the first chilean CubeSat developed by undergraduate students, engineers and professors of the Electrical Engineering, Physics and Mechanical Engineering Departments of the Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (FCFM) at Universidad de Chile. The main goal is to learn the whole chain process designing, building/integrating, launching and operating a picosatellite.

    - name: Fabless manufacturing of integrated circuits
      status: Active
      description: Integrations of circuits with the purpose of miniaturization of circuits for sensors used in several areas such as communications, biomedical, geophysics or astronomical instrumentation. Under the constant evolution of technology, the Space and Planetary Exploration Laboratory created a project with the point designing and implementing integrated circuits (IC), both analog and digital, to be used in different areas and for different purposes such as geophysics, biomedical, astronomical instrumentation, telecommunications, etc. Making use of "fabless manufacturing" philosophy, free software and the MOSIS educational program, we have manage to design small integrated amplifiers, the basic unit of any analog circuit such as ADC or DAC, and it is expected that in the near future that mixed signal circuit or fully digital, always with the assistance, cooperation and enthusiasm of colleagues and researchers from the Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile.

    - name: Seismic Register SPQR
      status: Active
      description: Primarily developed for Seismic Tomography this signal register (in development stage) is capable of digitalize, synchronize (to GPS time) and save to disk (MSEED, ASCII formats) signal samples from different sources. It is based on Low-cost and COTS products (Raspberry Pi and Arduino), the idea is to create an open Hw seismic register for scietific purposes.
